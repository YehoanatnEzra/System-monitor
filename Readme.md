# System Monitor 

The System Monitor project is a lightweight yet powerful tool designed to track system performance by monitoring CPU, memory, and disk usage in real-time. It logs the collected data into a file (`system_usage.log`) and issues alerts when resource consumption exceeds predefined thresholds. The project is fully automated, running every 5 minutes using GitHub Actions and Linux Cron Jobs, ensuring continuous tracking whether the machine is running or not. With its CI/CD pipeline, the logs are automatically updated and pushed to GitHub, providing a seamless and hands-free monitoring experience. This project is a great example of **Python scripting, automation, and cloud-based monitoring, making it useful for system administrators, developers, and tech enthusiasts alike.  

##  Why I Built This Project
I developed this project as a self-learning experience to improve my skills in GitHub actions, Bash scripting, CI/CD pipelines and Cron Jobs.
